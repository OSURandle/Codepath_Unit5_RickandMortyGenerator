# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: Joshua Randle

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Summary

RickandMortyGenerator is an android app that can display random characters from the tv show "Rick and Morty" and also allows users to search for characters from the show.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: üòÅü§™ü•≥

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [x] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is search query for character names
- [x] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is https://rickandmortyapi.com/.
